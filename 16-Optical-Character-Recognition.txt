Optical Character Recognition is a process of extracting printed or handwritten text in digital text format. 

OCR can be applied to:
Products 
Documents 
Invoices
Bills 
Financial Reports APIs that perform OCR extraction: 
OCR API and Read API


OCR API:
1. Older Recognition Model 
2. Supports only images 
3. Works well with smaller data 
4. Executes tasks Synchronously hence less time efficient
5. Supports more languages 
6. Easy to implement 



Read API 
1. Updated Recognition Model 
2. Supports images, videos, documents, pdfs 
3. Works great for larger data 
4. Executes tasks Asynchronously hence more time efficient 
5. Supports less languages 
6. Slightly difficult to implement
