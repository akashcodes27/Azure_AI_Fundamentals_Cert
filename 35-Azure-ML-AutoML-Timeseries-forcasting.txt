Time Series Forecasting is a machine learning technique used to predict future values based on data that is collected over time in a sequence. In a time series, each data point is linked to a timestamp (e.g., daily sales, hourly temperature, monthly stock prices). The key idea is that past patterns (like trends, seasonality, and cycles) can help forecast what will happen in the future. For example, by analyzing several years of retail sales data, a model can predict next monthâ€™s sales. Unlike regular regression, time series forecasting focuses on the order and timing of data, making it crucial for applications like demand planning, weather prediction, stock market analysis, and anomaly detection
