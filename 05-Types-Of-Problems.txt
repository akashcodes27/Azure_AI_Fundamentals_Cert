SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS 

Regression Problem: 

A regression problem is a type of supervised machine learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value (not a category). The model learns from labelled training data that has input features and a real-valued output, then tries to estimate that output for new, unseen data. To solve regression problems, we have regression models which basically model a linear relationship between one dependent variable(target variable) and multiple independent variables (features or attributes). The model basically learns relationships between seen inputs/outputs, and when presented with unseen inputs, it tries to find outputs that have a linear relationship with inputs(basically tries to find the best line or curve)
Mathematically, relationship between input variables and output variable is a function 

Example models: Linear regression, polynomial regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Support Vector Regressors, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression 


Examples:

Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of rooms.
Estimating a personâ€™s weight from their height and age.
Forecasting stock prices or temperature.


For Evaluation of the predictions generated through regression problem, we use evaluation metrics like: MSE, RMSE, MAE 
(Mean Squared Error), (Root Mean Squared Error), (Mean Absolute Error)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mean Squared Error: 
We take difference of (Actual and Prediction),
We square this difference 
We take summation of all squared differences 
We take average of the summation 

So the final value is always positive as we took square. Lower the value, more closer is the predicted value to ground truth. Larger the value, greater is the difference in ground truth and predicted values 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Root Mean Squared Error: Basically Square Root of Mean Squared Error. Why we did it? Because MSE values can show a very huge difference between prediction and ground truth. However RMSE gives us a more approximate and sensible difference value between prediction and ground truth 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mean Absolute Error: 
Very similar to MSE, the only difference: we take absolute value instead of square 

: We calculate difference between prediction and ground truth 
We take absolute value for each different (not square as we did in MSE)
We calculate average of the absolute value differences 
And thats it, the value we get is the MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Classification Problem: It is a Supervised Machine Learning problem which can be solved using Classification Algorithm. The algorithm takes as input a labelled dataset , analyses patterns and gives predictions in the form of separate classes or categories(and not continuous values). Mathematically relationship between input variables and output variable is a function.
Graphically, the classification function gives us a line which divides the categories into 2(or more parts), the position of the occurance of output variable decides the category of output variable.


Examples of Classification Problems:
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SupportVectorMachines, Naive Baiyes

UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS:

Clustering Problem:

Clustering Problem is an unsupervised machine learning problem that receives unlabelled datasets(or datasets with no pre-defined labels) during its training process. The algorithm does not know what the prediction should look like hence it is the algorithm's responsibility to identify patterns for all data points and create groups of data points on the basis of similarity of high value features. 
Some example clustering models: K-Means, K-Medoids, Density, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, GMM(Gausian Mixture Model)
