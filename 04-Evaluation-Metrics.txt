Evaluation Metrics:

Performance/Evaluation metrics are used to evaluate different machine learning models.

Different Evaluation Metrics are used for different kinds of problems:

1. Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC 
2. Regression Metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE
3. Ranking Metrics: MRR, DCG, NDCG 
4. Statistical Metrics: Correlation 
5. Computer Vision Metrics: PSNR, SSIM, IoU 
6. NLP Metrics: Perplexity, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE 
7. Deep Learning Related Metrics: Inception Score, Franchet Inception Distance
