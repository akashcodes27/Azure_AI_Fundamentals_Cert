LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service from Microsoft Azure that helps applications understand human language and extract meaning from it.
What it does: LUIS takes user input (typed text or spoken language) and figures out the intention (what the user wants to do) and the entities (important details in the sentence).

Example: If a user types “Book me a flight to Toronto tomorrow” →

Intent: BookFligh
Entities: Destination = Toronto, Date = tomorrow

Why it’s useful: It allows developers to build chatbots, virtual assistants, and apps that can understand natural language commands instead of fixed keywords.

Integration: LUIS can be combined with other services like Azure Bot Service or speech recognition to create smart conversational AI systems.

👉 In short: LUIS is Microsoft’s AI service that helps apps “understand” natural human language by identifying the user’s intent and extracting key information.


Core Schema of LUIS

A LUIS application is built on a schema, which defines three key parts:
Intents (Intentions)
Intents represent what the user wants to do.
Example: “Book me two flights to Toronto” → Intent = BookFlight.
A special None Intent always exists, used for inputs that don’t match any intent.

Entities

Entities are the specific details in the request that help complete the intent.
Example: In “Book me two flights to Toronto”:
Number of flights = two
Destination = Toronto
Entities act like the “data” extracted from a user’s request.

Utterances

Utterances are examples of what users might say.
These are used to train the ML model inside LUIS so it can recognize real-world phrasing.
Example utterances for a BookFlight intent might be:
“Book me a ticket to Paris”
“I need two flights to Toronto”
“Reserve a seat for tomorrow’s flight”
It’s recommended to provide 15–30 sample utterances per intent for better accuracy.
