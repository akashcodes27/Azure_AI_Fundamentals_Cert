Azure MLStudio Data Labeling:


Human-in-the-loop labeling:
We can assign or grant access to a bunch of people or a team of people to work on the Data Labeling Process(Data Annotation Process). This is known as  "Human-in-the loop labeling"


ML-assisted-labeling: 
We can also use ML to perform the labeling process 


We will encounter several different types of labeling tasks to choose from:

1. Image Classification (Multi-Class classification)
   Each image belongs to one category only


2. Image Classification (Multi-Label Classification)
   Multiple labels can be assigned to one image 

3. Object Detection 
   Draw bounding boxes around an object in an image and assign labels
