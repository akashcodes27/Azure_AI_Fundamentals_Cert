Scenario: Forecasting daily sales for a retail store

You have 3 years of sales data, with columns like:

Date

StoreID

Sales (target to predict)

Weather

Holiday



You want to predict next month’s sales. Here’s how those advanced configs are applied automatically in Azure ML:


1. Holiday detection and featurization

Azure checks the Date column → sees Dec 25 (Christmas) or Nov (Black Friday) → adds a feature called “Holiday = Yes/No” because sales usually spike during these days.
👉 So the model learns: If Holiday = Yes, Sales go up.



2. Time-series and DNN learners

Azure doesn’t force you to choose one model. It will try:
ARIMA (a statistical model, good for simple trends).
Prophet (handles seasonality, e.g., “every weekend sales increase”).
ForecastTCN (Deep Learning) (captures complex patterns).
👉 Azure tests them and picks the best performer.



3. Grouping (multiple series)

If you have 10 stores, Azure uses StoreID as a time series identifier.
👉 That way, it forecasts sales for each store separately, but still in one experiment.



4. Rolling-origin cross validation

Azure splits your historical data like this:
Train on Jan–Jun, test on Jul.
Train on Jan–Jul, test on Aug.

Train on Jan–Aug, test on Sep.
👉 This mimics real life, where you always train on the past and predict the future.



5. Configurable lags

Azure automatically creates features like:
Sales 1 day ago (lag-1).
Sales 7 days ago (lag-7).
Sales 30 days ago (lag-30).
👉 The model then learns patterns like “Sales today look similar to sales one week ago.”
