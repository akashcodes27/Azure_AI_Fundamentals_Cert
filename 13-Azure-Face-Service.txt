Face Service 

Azure Face Service provides AI algorithms that can detect, analyze, and recognize human faces. 


Azure Face Service can detect: 
Faces in an image, 

Face landmarks: There are upto 27 predefined landmark points in an image 

Face attributes in an image: A key-value pair dictionary can be created containing the different face attributes, eg: Age, Gender, Exposure, Emotion, Accessories, Glasses, Hair etc 

Similar Faces,

Same face as a specific identity across a gallery of images 

Each face detected has a separate identity hence there is a "Unique Identifier String" for each face detected in the image
