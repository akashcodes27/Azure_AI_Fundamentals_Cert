That code you see in the slide is more like a “main pipeline script” (an orchestrator). It doesn’t actually do the detailed data cleaning or model training itself. Instead, it:

Defines the workflow → specifies the sequence of steps (data prep → training → evaluation, etc.).

Points to the implementations → each step calls an external script (dataprep.py, train.py, etc.) where the actual logic lives.

Assigns resources → tells Azure which compute target (CPU cluster, GPU cluster) to use for each step.

Connects inputs and outputs → passes processed data from one step to the next.

Submits the pipeline as a run → so Azure ML executes everything, tracks metrics, and stores outputs.

👉 Think of it like this:

The pipeline script = the conductor of an orchestra 🎼.

The individual scripts (dataprep.py, train.py, etc.) = the musicians 🎻🎺🎹 actually performing tasks.

Azure ML = the concert hall 🏟️ providing compute resources and recording the performance (runs, metrics).

So yes, the pipeline code is an abstracted “main file” that organizes the ML workflow but relies on step scripts for the detailed implementation.
